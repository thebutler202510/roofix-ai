Create a comprehensive "Contractor Tools" page for commercial roofing professionals with interactive calculators and utilities. PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: 1. CREATE TOOLS PAGE: Create a page at /tools with: - Page Title: "Contractor Tools - Professional Roofing Calculators" - Subtitle: "Streamline your roofing projects with AI-powered tools" - Grid layout displaying tool cards (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile) 2. IMPLEMENT THESE TOOLS: TOOL 1: ROI CALCULATOR - Title: "Roofing Project ROI Calculator" - Description: "Calculate return on investment for roofing projects" - Inputs: * Project Cost ($) * Current Energy Cost ($/month) * Expected Energy Savings (%) * Roof Lifespan (years) * Maintenance Cost Savings ($/year) - Outputs: * Total Savings Over Lifespan * Payback Period (years) * Annual ROI (%) * Break-even Point - Display results with visual chart (bar or line graph) TOOL 2: WIND UPLIFT CALCULATOR - Title: "Wind Uplift Pressure Calculator" - Description: "Calculate wind uplift forces for proper fastener selection" - Inputs: * Building Height (feet) * Wind Speed (mph) - with common zone presets (90, 110, 130, 150 mph) * Roof Zone (Corner, Edge, Field) * Building Exposure (B, C, D) * Roof Slope (degrees or ratio) - Outputs: * Design Wind Pressure (psf) * Required Fastener Spacing * Recommended Attachment Pattern * Safety Factor Applied - Include reference to ASCE 7 standards TOOL 3: SQUARE FOOTAGE CALCULATOR - Title: "Roof Area Calculator" - Description: "Calculate roof square footage and material quantities" - Inputs: * Roof Type (Flat, Gable, Hip, Complex) * Dimensions (length × width in feet) * Roof Pitch/Slope (for sloped roofs) * Waste Factor (% - default 10%) - Outputs: * Total Roof Area (sq ft) * Roofing Squares (÷100) * Material Needed (with waste factor) * Estimated Membrane Rolls (based on roll size) TOOL 4: INSULATION R-VALUE CALCULATOR - Title: "Insulation R-Value Calculator" - Description: "Determine required insulation for energy efficiency" - Inputs: * Climate Zone (dropdown with US zones 1-8) * Building Type (Commercial, Industrial, Institutional) * Current R-Value (if retrofit) * Target Energy Savings (%) - Outputs: * Recommended R-Value * Insulation Thickness Needed * Annual Energy Savings Estimate * Insulation Type Recommendations (Polyiso, XPS, EPS) TOOL 5: PROJECT ESTIMATOR - Title: "Quick Project Cost Estimator" - Description: "Estimate commercial roofing project costs" - Inputs: * Roof Area (sq ft) * System Type (TPO, PVC, EPDM, Modified Bitumen, Built-Up) * Installation Method (Fully Adhered, Mechanically Attached, Ballasted) * Insulation Required (Yes/No) * Tear-off Needed (Yes/No) * Region (affects labor costs) - Outputs: * Material Cost Estimate * Labor Cost Estimate * Total Project Cost Range (Low/Mid/High) * Cost per Square * Estimated Timeline (days) TOOL 6: SLOPE CALCULATOR - Title: "Roof Slope/Pitch Calculator" - Description: "Convert between slope formats and calculate drainage" - Inputs: * Input Format (Rise/Run, Degrees, Percentage, Inches per Foot) * Value to convert - Outputs: * All format conversions displayed * Minimum slope recommendations for different systems * Drainage adequacy indicator 3. UI/UX DESIGN: Tool Card Design: - Icon for each tool (calculator, wind, ruler, etc.) - Tool title and short description - "Launch Tool" button - Color-coded badges (ROI, Safety, Measurement, etc.) Tool Modal/Drawer: - Click "Launch Tool" opens full calculator in modal or side panel - Clean form layout with labeled inputs - Real-time calculation as user types - "Calculate" or "Recalculate" button - "Save Results" button (saves to user's account if logged in) - "Print" or "Export PDF" option - "Clear" button to reset form 4. CALCULATION LOGIC: ROI Calculator: - Total Savings = (Energy Savings × 12 × Lifespan) + (Maintenance Savings × Lifespan) - Payback Period = Project Cost / (Annual Energy Savings + Annual Maintenance Savings) - Annual ROI = (Total Savings - Project Cost) / Project Cost / Lifespan × 100 Wind Uplift: - Use ASCE 7 formulas: Design Pressure = qh × GCp - qh = 0.00256 × Kz × Kzt × Kd × V² (velocity pressure) - Zone factors: Corner = 1.5, Edge = 1.2, Field = 1.0 - Include exposure coefficients Square Footage: - Flat: Length × Width - Gable: Length × Width × (1 + (Rise²/Run²)^0.5) - Add waste factor percentage 5. STYLING: - Match RooFix Academy and Documents page styling - Blue/cyan theme consistent with brand - Responsive grid layout - Smooth animations for tool launches - Input validation with helpful error messages - Loading states for calculations - Success states with green highlights on results 6. NAVIGATION: - Add "Tools" to main navigation menu between "Features" and "Pricing" - Add breadcrumb: Home > Tools > [Tool Name] when tool is open 7. DATABASE (OPTIONAL): - Create table "tool_calculations" to save user's calculation history: * user_id * tool_name * inputs (JSON) * outputs (JSON) * created_at - Only save if user is logged in - Add "My Saved Calculations" section at top of tools page 8. MOBILE OPTIMIZATION: - Single column layout on mobile - Touch-friendly input fields - Number pads for numeric inputs - Collapsible result sections - Easy scrolling between input and output IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: - Use React state for real-time calculations - Include input validation (prevent negative numbers, require all fields, etc.) - Add tooltips with help text for technical terms - Include "Learn More" links that reference industry standards - Add disclaimer: "These calculators provide estimates. Consult with engineering professionals for final specifications." - Track tool usage analytics (which tools are most popular) NICE-TO-HAVE FEATURES: - Unit conversion toggle (Imperial/Metric) - Save calculation results as PDF - Email results to client - Share calculation link with team members - Comparison mode (compare 2 scenarios side-by-side) Please implement this Contractor Tools page with at least the first 4 calculators (ROI, Wind Uplift, Square Footage, and Insulation R-Value) to start, ensuring it matches the existing design system and is mobile-responsive.
